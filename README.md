# Zahhak, a C# 6.0 coding sample in form of a console game.![Screenshot](pics/zahhak.png)## Download[Click here to download the game.](downloads/Zahhak.zip?raw=true)It runs on Windows, OS X, and Linux**OBS!** One must have the .NET Framework or Mono installed.## PurposeTo create a simple game for beginners to learn the C# programming language. I tried to use the full capabilities of C# 6.0 and make the code as easy to understand as possible, therefore it may seem that it should be optimized more.I do hope that teachers use the code as a learning exercise for students.## DevelopmentThis was written in C# 6.0 with Visual Studio 2015. One must also  **install Rx-Main using NuGet**, in order to compile the program.## Documentation### Abstract class```internal abstract class GameObject{...}```They are classes that cannot be instantiated, and are frequently either partially implemented, or not at all implemented.## MiscellaneousCheck out my programming blog! http://ar.hn/blog## LicenseCopyright (c) 2016 Aryo Pehlewan feylikurds@gmail.com Licensed under the GPL license.
